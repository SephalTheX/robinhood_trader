# robinhood_trader

This project was meant to create a template for stocks analysis. My personal goal is to be able to trade options algorithmicly on Robinhood, so the project's main goal is derived towards finiding optimal spots to purchase Option shares (Put and Call).

Feel free to Fork the project or send any suggestions!
